    This is the home of the pipeline, nanite. Its long-term goals: to assemble, annotate, and screen nanopore samples like no pipeline before!
  </i>
</div>

## Overview
Welcome to nanite! Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through [nanite's documentation](https://openomics.github.io/nanite/).

The **`./nanite`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

 * [<code>nanite <b>run</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nanite/usage/run/): Run the nanite pipeline with your input files.
 * [<code>nanite <b>unlock</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nanite/usage/unlock/): Unlocks a previous runs output directory.
 * [<code>nanite <b>install</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nanite/usage/install/): Download reference files locally.
 * [<code>nanite <b>cache</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/nanite/usage/cache/): Cache software containers locally.

**nanite** is a streamlined viral metagenomics pipeline to assemble, annotate, and classify microorganisms in enviromental samples. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from [Nanopore sequencing technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/). As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](https://openomics.github.io/nanite/usage/run/) section of each available sub command.

For more information about issues or trouble-shooting a problem, please checkout our [FAQ](https://openomics.github.io/nanite/faq/questions/) prior to [opening an issue on Github](https://github.com/OpenOmics/nanite/issues).

## Dependencies
**Requires:** `singularity>=3.5`  `snakemake>=6.0`  `conda/mamba (optional)` 

[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) must be installed on the target system. Snakemake is a workflow manager that orchestrates each step of the pipeline. The second dependency, i.e [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/all-releases) OR [conda/mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge), handles the dowloading/installation of any remaining software dependencies. By default, the pipeline will utilize singularity to guarantee the highest level of reproducibility; however, the `--use-conda` option of the [run](https://openomics.github.io/nanite/usage/run/) sub command can be provided to  use conda/mamba instead of singularity. If possible, we recommend using singularity over conda for reproducibility; however, it is worth noting that singularity and conda produce identical results for this pipeline. 

If you are running the pipeline on Windows, please use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Singularity can be installed on WSL following these [instructions](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2021/09/using-singularity-on-windows-with-wsl2/).

## Installation
Please clone this repository to your local filesystem using the following command:
