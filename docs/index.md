    This is the home of the pipeline, baseline. Its long-term goals: to accurately ...insert goal, to infer ..insert goal, and to boldly ..insert goal like no pipeline before!

## Overview
Welcome to baseline's documentation! This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with the [long pipeline name](https://github.com/OpenOmics/baseline/). 

The **`./baseline`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

 * [<code>baseline <b>run</b></code>](usage/run.md): Run the baseline pipeline with your input files.
 * [<code>baseline <b>unlock</b></code>](usage/unlock.md): Unlocks a previous runs output directory.
 * [<code>baseline <b>cache</b></code>](usage/cache.md): Cache remote resources locally, coming soon!

**baseline** is a comprehensive ...insert long description. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](usage/run.md) section of each available sub command.
